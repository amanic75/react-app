## üéØ **Real-World Test Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Cost Optimization Project
```
1. "I need to reduce our industrial cleaner costs by 20%. Current formula: SDS 25%, EDTA 5%, Citric Acid 3%, Water 67%"
2. Follow up: "What are the safety implications of your recommendations?"
3. Follow up: "Help me find suppliers for the alternative materials you suggested"
```

### Scenario 2: Safety Investigation
```
1. "Safety review needed: we're storing ammonia-based cleaners next to chlorine bleach"
2. Follow up: "What storage protocols should we implement?"
3. Follow up: "Create a compliance checklist for OSHA inspection"
```

### Scenario 3: Quality Problem Solving
```
1. "Urgent: Our last 5 batches of coating failed adhesion tests. pH is 8.2 (should be 7.5-8.0)"
2. Follow up: "Walk me through systematic diagnosis of this pH issue"
3. Follow up: "What preventive measures will stop this from recurring?"
```

## üìä **Expected Performance Improvements**

| Capability | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Response Structure** | Plain text | Organized sections with visual indicators |
| **Actionability** | General advice | Specific step-by-step guidance |
| **Safety Focus** | Mentioned | Highlighted with risk levels |
| **Business Impact** | Implied | Quantified cost/time savings |
| **Follow-up Value** | Limited | Rich context for deep-dive conversations |

---

## üö® **Known Limitations & Verification Notes**

- **Cost estimates**: AI provides market estimates - always verify with current suppliers
- **Safety assessments**: For critical applications, consult safety data sheets and experts  
- **Regulatory compliance**: Check latest regulations for your specific jurisdiction
- **Supplier recommendations**: Research suggested suppliers independently

---

## üí° **Pro Tips for Best Results**

1. **Be specific**: "Reduce viscosity in paint formula" vs "My paint formula has issues"
2. **Provide context**: Include current costs, specifications, constraints
3. **Ask follow-ups**: Use recommendations to drill deeper into solutions
4. **Combine capabilities**: Start with optimization, then check safety, then find suppliers
