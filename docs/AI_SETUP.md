# AI Chatbot Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (OpenAI Integration)

Your chatbot is now configured to use OpenAI's API. Follow these steps to make it functional:

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Set Environment Variable
I've created a `.env` file for you. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
```

Note: In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the browser.

⚠️ **Important**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to keep your API key secure!

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the chatbot in your application
3. Send a message about chemical formulas or safety protocols
4. The AI should respond with relevant information

## Alternative AI Services

### Option 2: Anthropic Claude (Alternative)
If you prefer Claude over OpenAI:

1. Install Claude SDK: `npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk`
2. Update `src/lib/aiService.js` to use Anthropic instead
3. Add `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your `.env` file

### Option 3: Azure OpenAI (Enterprise)
For enterprise deployments:

1. Set up Azure OpenAI Service
2. Update the OpenAI configuration in `aiService.js`
3. Add Azure-specific environment variables

## Production Considerations

### Security
- **Never expose API keys in frontend code**
- Create a backend API endpoint to proxy AI requests
- Implement rate limiting and authentication

### Backend Implementation (Recommended)
Create an API endpoint like:
```javascript
// backend/api/ai-chat.js
app.post('/api/ai-chat', async (req, res) => {
  // Validate user authentication
  // Call AI service server-side
  // Return response
});
```

### Cost Management
- Set usage limits in your OpenAI dashboard
- Monitor token usage
- Implement message length limits
- Consider caching common responses

## Advanced Features

### File Upload Processing
The chatbot supports file uploads but currently only sends file metadata. To process actual file content:

1. **PDF Processing**: Use `pdf-parse` library
2. **Image Analysis**: Use OpenAI Vision API
3. **Excel/CSV**: Use libraries like `xlsx` or `csv-parser`

### Custom Training
For chemical industry-specific responses:

1. **Fine-tuning**: Train on your chemical data
2. **Vector Search**: Use embeddings for document search
3. **RAG System**: Combine AI with your knowledge base

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"API key not found"**: Check your `.env` file
- **CORS errors**: API key should be used server-side
- **Rate limiting**: Implement request throttling

### Error Handling
The chatbot includes error handling for:
- API failures
- Network issues
- Invalid responses

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Set up OpenAI API key
2. ✅ Test basic functionality
3. 🔄 Implement backend proxy (recommended)
4. 🔄 Add file content processing
5. 🔄 Customize for chemical industry needs
6. 🔄 Deploy with production security

## Problem Summary
The "Assigned to me" tab in the React app (Raw Materials and Formulas pages) is not showing any results even though items should be assigned to the current user. This is a critical filtering issue that prevents users from seeing their assigned work.

## What We've Done So Far

### ✅ Database Schema Conversion
- **COMPLETED**: Successfully converted `assigned_to` columns from single UUID to UUID[] arrays in all tables (raw_materials, formulas, suppliers)
- **COMPLETED**: Updated RLS policies to work with array format using `auth.uid() = ANY(assigned_to)`
- **COMPLETED**: Added GIN indexes for better array query performance
- **COMPLETED**: Replaced foreign key constraints with validation triggers
- **COMPLETED**: SQL scripts are ready and tested

### ✅ React Frontend Updates
- **COMPLETED**: Created `src/lib/filterUtils.js` with robust filtering functions that handle both UUID and UUID[] formats
- **COMPLETED**: Updated filtering logic in `src/pages/RawMaterialsPage.jsx` and `src/pages/FormulasPage.jsx`
- **COMPLETED**: Added backward compatibility for transition period
- **COMPLETED**: Removed debugging code for clean production

### ✅ Documentation and Testing Tools
- **COMPLETED**: Created `ASSIGNED_TO_FILTERING_FIX.md` with step-by-step instructions
- **COMPLETED**: Created `sql code/test_assignment.sql` for testing assignments
- **COMPLETED**: All debugging utilities created and then removed

## Current Status
- Database conversion was successful - all `assigned_to` columns are now UUID[] arrays
- React filtering logic has been updated to work with arrays
- All items currently have empty assignment arrays `[]` (no assignments exist)
- The filtering logic should work, but needs testing with actual user assignments

## What Still Needs to be Done

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Test with Real User Assignments
The filtering appears to work at the database level, but all items currently have empty assignments. You need to:

1. **Get the current user ID** - Run this in browser console:
   ```javascript
   const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   console.log('Current user ID:', user.id);
   ```

2. **Assign some items to the current user** - Use this SQL in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Replace 'your-user-id-here' with the actual user ID from step 1
   UPDATE formulas 
   SET assigned_to = ARRAY['your-user-id-here']::UUID[]
   WHERE id IN ('FORM001', 'FORM002');
   
   UPDATE raw_materials 
   SET assigned_to = ARRAY['your-user-id-here']::UUID[]
   WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM raw_materials LIMIT 2);
   ```

3. **Test the "Assigned to me" tab** - Should now show results

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Verify Data Format
Check that the database conversion worked correctly:
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  table_name,
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name IN ('raw_materials', 'formulas', 'suppliers') 
AND column_name = 'assigned_to';
```
Should show `data_type: "ARRAY"` for all three tables.

### 🟡 INVESTIGATE: Why Initial Testing Failed
The user reported "it didn't work" after the database conversion. Possible issues:
1. **No assignments exist** - All items have empty arrays (most likely)
2. **User ID mismatch** - Auth user ID doesn't match assigned user IDs
3. **Frontend caching** - Browser cache preventing updates
4. **Authentication issues** - User not properly authenticated

### 🟡 OPTIONAL: Assignment Management UI
Consider adding UI for admins to assign items to users instead of manual SQL updates.

## Key Files to Examine

### Core Files
- `src/lib/filterUtils.js` - Contains `filterByTab()` function that handles the filtering
- `src/pages/RawMaterialsPage.jsx` - Uses filtering utility for raw materials
- `src/pages/FormulasPage.jsx` - Uses filtering utility for formulas
- `src/lib/supabaseData.js` - Database queries (may need to verify data fetching)

### SQL Scripts (Already Run Successfully)
- `sql code/fix_assigned_to_simple.sql` - Main conversion script (COMPLETED)
- `sql code/test_assignment.sql` - Test assignment script (READY TO USE)

### Documentation
- `ASSIGNED_TO_FILTERING_FIX.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide
- `NEXT_CHAT_PROMPT.md` - This file

## Expected Behavior
- **"All" tab**: Shows all items regardless of assignment
- **"Assigned to me" tab**: Shows only items where current user ID is in the assigned_to array
- **"Created by me" tab**: Shows only items where current user ID matches created_by

## Debugging Steps for Next Session

### 1. Quick Health Check
```javascript
// Run in browser console
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('User:', user?.id, user?.email);

const { data: materials } = await supabase
  .from('raw_materials')
  .select('id, material_name, assigned_to')
  .limit(3);
console.log('Materials:', materials);
```

### 2. Test Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Test the filtering utility directly
import { filterByTab } from './src/lib/filterUtils';
const testItems = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Test Item', assigned_to: ['your-user-id'] },
  { id: 2, name: 'Other Item', assigned_to: ['other-user-id'] }
];
const filtered = filterByTab(testItems, 'assigned', { id: 'your-user-id' });
console.log('Filtered:', filtered); // Should show only first item
```

### 3. Check Database State
```sql
-- Count assignments by table
SELECT 
  'raw_materials' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_items,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN array_length(assigned_to, 1) > 0 THEN 1 END) as assigned_items
FROM raw_materials
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'formulas' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_items,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN array_length(assigned_to, 1) > 0 THEN 1 END) as assigned_items
FROM formulas;
```

## Most Likely Solution
The filtering logic is probably working correctly, but there are simply no items assigned to the current user. The solution is likely just:
1. Get current user ID
2. Assign a few test items using the SQL script
3. Test the "Assigned to me" tab

## App Details
- React app running on `http://localhost:5178/`
- Supabase backend with PostgreSQL
- Multi-tenant application with role-based access
- User executes SQL scripts in Supabase SQL Editor

## Quick Win
If you just want to verify it's working:
1. Run the test assignment SQL (replace user ID)
2. Check the "Assigned to me" tab
3. Should show filtered results

Good luck! The heavy lifting is done - you just need to test with real assignments. 🚀 # AI Accuracy Enhancement Implementation Guide
