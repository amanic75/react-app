-- SECURE STORAGE POLICIES FOR FORMULA DOCUMENTS

-- Phase 2: Company-based isolation and uploader permissions

-- First, drop the basic policies we created for testing

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates to formula documents" ON storage.objects;

-- SECURE POLICY 1: COMPANY-BASED UPLOADS
-- ==============================================

-- SECURE POLICY 2: COMPANY-BASED DOWNLOADS
-- ==============================================

-- SECURE POLICY 3: UPLOADER-ONLY UPDATES
-- ==============================================

-- SECURE POLICY 4: UPLOADER-ONLY DELETES
-- ==============================================
